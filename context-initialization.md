You are assisting on a production-grade Flutter application.

Before generating any code, you must understand and strictly
follow the architectural constraints defined below.

APPLICATION CONTEXT
- Platform: Flutter (Android, iOS, Web)
- Architecture: Layered MVVM-inspired
- State management: Provider with ChangeNotifier
- Goal: scalability, maintainability, testability
- App scale: medium to large
- Team size: multiple developers

YOUR TASK
1. Describe the high-level architecture
2. Define each layer and its responsibility
3. Explain allowed and forbidden dependencies
4. Describe the data flow from UI to API
5. Identify common architectural pitfalls to avoid

IMPORTANT RULES
- Do NOT generate any Dart code yet
- Explain decisions clearly
- Ask for clarification if assumptions are required
